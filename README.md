# FlyDashboard

The goal of this project is to create a simple [dashboard](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/dashboards/what-is) from a set of 500 tweets about flying and climate change.

Each tweet has the following 18 fields:

- tweet_id
- author_id
- created_at
- text
- lang
- source
- public_metrics_like_count
- public_metrics_quote_count
- public_metrics_reply_count
- public_metrics_retweet_count
- author_created_at
- author_username
- author_name
- author_description
- author_public_metrics_followers_count
- author_public_metrics_following_count
- author_public_metrics_listed_count
- author_public_metrics_tweet_count
